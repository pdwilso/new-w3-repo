# ðŸ‘‹ Hello developer!

This is one of the many templates available from W3Schools. We recommend exploring our [tutorials for frontend development](https://www.w3schools.com/where_to_start.asp) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the basics of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp). As a supplement to your already advanced skills in PHP, we also recommend utilizing our [PHP tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp) to enhance your coding experience.ðŸ¦„

## Knowledge requirements

In order to fully comprehend and tailor this template to your specific requirements, it is recommended that you possess a certain level of knowledge and understanding of the following concepts:

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
- [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
- [PHP](https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp)

## ðŸ”¨ What's next?

Customize this template to make it your own.  
Remember it is important to ensure that the layout is responsive in order to optimize the viewing experience on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

## Important

Save the files inside `src/`.
## ðŸŽ¨ Where to find everything?

This template is made by using several technologies.
Below are explanations about where to find specific code.

### HTML

The HTML is baked into PHP files. You can find the `index.php` in `src/`.

### CSS

CSS files can be found in `/src/style.css`.  

### Core files

You can find:
  - the index in `src/index.php`.

### Database

Dynamic spaces can use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) database.  
The database file is called `database.db`. It is placed inside the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder.  
SQLite connection path to the database is `w3s-dynamic-storage/database.db` which you can use to connect to the SQLite database programmatically.   

---  
**Do not change the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name!**  
**By changing the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name, you risk the space not working properly.**

## ðŸ”¨ Please note
For now files created/uploaded or edited from within the terminal view will not be backed up or synced.
