## Important

Save the files inside `src/`.
## ðŸŽ¨ Where to find everything?

This template is made by using several technologies.
Below are explanations about where to find specific code.

### HTML

The HTML is baked into PHP files. You can find the `index.php` in `src/`.

### CSS

CSS files can be found in `/src/style.css`.  

### Core files

You can find:
  - the index in `src/index.php`.

### Database

Dynamic spaces can use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) database.  
The database file is called `database.db`. It is placed inside the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder.  
SQLite connection path to the database is `w3s-dynamic-storage/database.db` which you can use to connect to the SQLite database programmatically.   

---  
**Do not change the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name!**  
**By changing the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name, you risk the space not working properly.**

## ðŸ”¨ Please note
For now files created/uploaded or edited from within the terminal view will not be backed up or synced.
