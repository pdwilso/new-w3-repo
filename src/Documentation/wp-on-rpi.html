      How to Host a WordPress Site on Raspberry Pi
    </h1>
  <p>BY  <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/author/ccawley/">CHRISTIAN CAWLEY</a></p>
  <p>UPDATED  FEB 15, 2021</p>

    <p>Want to host your own WordPress site on Raspberry Pi? Here’s
    how to get started by installing LAMP and WordPress.</p>

    <p>If you want the most hassle-free WordPress experience, a
    managed WordPress host like WP Engine handles all the setup and
    support so you can focus on your content. It’s what we use to run
    our own sister sites.</p>
    
    <p>But if you don’t have any funds, or just want to flex your DIY
    skills, then you can use a Raspberry Pi for your WordPress
    site.</p>

    <p>Here’s how to set up Apache, MySQL, and PHP on your Raspberry
    Pi and host websites, both locally and on the web.</p>

    <h2 id="why-use-wordpress">Why Use WordPress?</h2>

    <p>If you’re looking for a way to host a website with the minimum
    of fuss, WordPress isn’t the obvious solution. We’ve already
    looked at how to configure the Raspberry Pi to host a static or
    dynamic website (that is, one that relies on standard, prewritten
    pages, or a site that uses a database to populate pages).</p>

    <p>But if you really need to use WordPress, or you’re developing a
    theme or plugins for a WordPress site, then having a Raspberry Pi
    with the blogging platform installed and ready to use is a great
    option.</p>

    <h2 id="which-raspberry-pi-should-you-use">Which Raspberry Pi Should You Use?</h2>
    <h3 id="raspberry-pi-3-and-raspberry-pi-3-b">Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi 3 B+</h3>

    <p>To install WordPress on a Raspberry Pi, you’ll need to set it
    up as a LAMP server. With Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP installed,
    your Pi will then be able to handle WordPress (and other website
    software).</p>

    <p>Several models of Raspberry Pi are available. You might have
    one, several, or none. But which one is the most suitable for
    running WordPress?</p>

    <p>Happily, any version of the Raspberry Pi can be used to host a
    WordPress site. However, for the best results, we recommend you
    use a Raspberry Pi 2 or later. Additionally, ensure you’re using a
    larger SD card—at least 16GB—as storage space is a key requirement
    for web servers. (Also consider some external storage for the
    Pi!)</p>

    <p>The rest of this tutorial assumes that your Raspberry Pi is
    powered on and connected to your local network. You should also
    have SSH configured, for remote command line access.</p>

    <h4 id="step-1-set-up-apache-web-server">Step 1: Set Up Apache Web Server</h4>

    <p>Start off by installing the Apache web server. This is software
    that lets you serve any type of webpage to any browser. It’s all
    you need to serve a HTML page, static or dynamically created with
    PHP.</p>

    <pre>
      sudo apt install apache2 -y
    </pre>

    <p>Once installed, Apache will drop a test HTML file into the web
    folder on your Pi. You should test this from another computer (or
    smartphone) on your network. You’ll need to enter the IP address
    of the Pi in the address bar of your browser. If you’re using SSH,
    you’ll know this already; otherwise, enter:</p>

    <pre>
      hostname -I
    </pre>

    <p>This displays the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. The page you
    see should be something like this:</p>

    <h5 id="apache-server-installed-on-raspberry-pi">
      Apache server installed on Raspberry Pi
    </h5>
    
    <p>You can also check the web page works from your Raspberry Pi
    using the <code>http://localhost</code> address.</p>

    <h4 id="step-2-install-php-on-raspberry-pi">Step 2: Install PHP on Raspberry Pi</h4>

    <p>Next, it’s time to install PHP. This is a software
    pre-processor that enables the serving of server-generated web
    pages rather than static HTML pages. While an HTML page might be
    written in its entirety, a PHP page will feature calls to other
    pages, and the database, to populate it with content.</p>

    <p>While other server-side platforms are available (such as ASP),
    PHP is vital here as it is required for WordPress because
    WordPress itself is written in PHP.</p>

    <p>Install with:</p>

    <pre><code>
      sudo apt install php -y
    </code></pre>

    <p>Once this is done, you should test that PHP works. Change
    directory to /var/www/html/ like this:</p>

    <pre><code>
      cd /var/www/html/
    </code></pre>

    <p>Here, delete the index.html file (the web page you viewed
    earlier):</p>

    <pre><code>
      sudo rm index.html
    </code></pre>

    <p>Next, create a new file called index.php (nano is installed by
    default):</p>

    <pre><code>
      sudo nano index.php
    </code></pre>

    <p>Here, add any (or all) of the following code:</p>

    <pre><code>
      &lt;?php echo "hello world"; ?&gt;
      &lt;?php echo date('Y-m-d H:i:s'); ?&gt;
      &lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>In order, these commands display:</p>

    <pre><code>
      The phrase "hello world"
      The current date and time
      PHP info for the installation
    </code></pre>

    <p>Save the file, then restart Apache:</p>

    <pre><code>
      sudo service apache2 restart
    </code></pre>

    <p>Refresh the page to see the results.</p>

    <h5 id="php-installed-and-working-on-raspberry-pi">
      PHP installed and working on Raspberry Pi
    </h5>
    
    <p>PHP and Apache are both working. Now it’s time to install the
      database software, MySQL.</p>
    
    <h4 id="step-3-install-mysql-on-raspberry-pi">Step 3: Install MySQL on Raspberry Pi</h4>

    <p>WordPress (and other dynamically generated website software)
    requires a database in order to store the content, links to
    images, and manage user access (among many other things). This
    project uses a fork of MySQL called MariaDB:</p>

    <pre><code>
      sudo apt install mysql-server php-mysql -y
    </code></pre>

    <p>Once this is installed, you will once again need to restart
    Apache:</p>

    <pre><code>
      sudo service apache2 restart
    </code></pre>

    <p>As noted, other database options are available for this type of
    project. However, for the best results, especially if this is your
    first time configuring a web server, stick with MySQL.</p>

    <h4 id="step-4-install-wordpress-on-raspberry-pi">
      Step 4: Install WordPress on Raspberry Pi
    </h4>

    <p>To install WordPress, you’ll first need to install it. Before
    doing this, however, delete the contents of the /html/
    directory:</p>

    <pre><code>
      cd /var/www/html/
      sudo rm *
    </code></pre>

    <p>The asterisk wildcard (*) deletes everything in the directory
    thanks to the rm (remove) command.</p>

    <h5 id="download-wordpress-with-wget">
      Download WordPress with wget
    </h5>

    <p>Next, use wget to download the latest version of WordPress:</p>

    <pre><code>
      sudo wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
    </code></pre>

    <p>Once downloaded, extract the contents:</p>

    <pre><code>
      sudo tar xzf latest.tar.gz
    </code></pre>

    <p>The wordpress directory should be created, but you want the
    contents of it in html. While you might move these manually using
    the desktop user interface, it’s simple to do this from the
    command line:</p>

    <pre><code>
      sudo mv wordpress/* .
    </code></pre>

    <p>Be sure to include the space and period at the end, which refer
    to the current directory!</p>

    <p>Enter ls to confirm the directory is full of WordPress folders
    and PHP files:<br/>
    <img src="./muo-diy-raspberrypi-wordpress-directory.png"
    alt="wordpress dir"/></p>

    <h5 id="move-the-contents-of-the-wordpress-directory">
      Move the contents of the WordPress directory
    </h5>
    
    <p>Before proceeding, tidy things up a bit, discarding the
      downloaded file and the wordpress directory:</p>
    
    <pre><code>
      sudo rm -rf wordpress latest.tar.gz
    </code></pre>

    <p>Next, set the Apache user as the owner of the directory:</p>

    <pre><code>
      sudo chown -R www-data: .
    </code></pre>

    <h4 id="step-5-configure-mysql">Step 5: Configure MySQL</h4>

    <p>To set up the database, you’ll first need to run the
    installation command:</p>

    <pre><code>
      sudo mysql_secure_installation
    </code></pre>

    <p>You’ll shortly be prompted to set a root password. Follow the
    onscreen instructions, making sure you keep a note of the
    password, as it will be required later.</p>

    <p>Once this is one, the following prompts will appear:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Remove anonymous users</li>
      <li>Disallow root login remotely</li>
      <li>Remove test database and access to it</li>
      <li>Reload privilege tables now</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For each of these, tap Y to confirm. When done, the “All done!”
    message will be displayed.</p>

    <h4 id="step-6-create-the-wordpress-database">Step 6: Create the WordPress Database</h4>

    <p>To install WordPress, you’ll first need to configure the
    database. Begin by running the mysql command, entering the
      password from earlier.</p>
    
    <pre><code>
      sudo mysql -uroot -p
    </code></pre>

    <p>This opens the MariaDB monitor. At the prompt, create the
    database:</p>

    <pre><code>
      create database wordpress;
    </code></pre>

    <p>Note how all commands within the MariaDB monitor end with a
    “;”. Next, the root user needs database privileges. Use your own
    password in place of PASSWORD.</p>

    <pre><code>
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>Follow this by flushing previous database privileges:</p>

    <pre><code>
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    </code></pre>

    <p>Exit the MariaDB database management tool with Ctrl + D.</p>

    <h4 id="step-7-install-and-configure-wordpress">
      Step 7: Install and Configure WordPress
    </h4>

    <p>Installing WordPress is simple; if you’ve already done it on an
    existing website, you should know what to do.</p>

    <p>Open the website in your browser (as described above). You
    should see the WordPress Setup screen. Select your language, then
    Continue, and make a note of what is required: the database name,
    username, password, host, and the table prefix (this is for the
      database tables).</p>
    
    <p>If you made it this far, you should have named the database
    “wordpress”, and have a note of the password. The Username is
    root, and the host localhost. The Table Prefix is wp_.</p>

    <p>Click Submit, then Run the install, and input the Site Title,
    along with the Username, and Password for your administrator
    account. Click Install WordPress, and wait as WordPress is
    (quickly) set up.</p>

    <p>To login to your WordPress installation, go
    to <a href="http://localhost/wp-admin">http://localhost/wp-admin</a>.</p>

    <p>At this stage, you have a site you can start using. Our guide
    to getting started with WordPress will help here. Don’t forget to
    choose a theme, and a few useful plugins. You’ll also need a
    method to access the site from the internet.</p>

    <h5 id="access-your-wordpress-site-from-the-internet">
      Access Your WordPress Site From the Internet
    </h5>

    <p>As things stand, you’ll probably only be able to access the
    site from within your home network. To change this, you’ll need a
    static IP address, and manage port forwarding from your router to
    your Raspberry Pi.</p>

    <p>Static IP addresses are expensive, however, but you can use a
    dynamic DNS provider instead. This basically links a custom URL to
    your Raspberry Pi, although such services are often paid. Check
    our list of the best dynamic DNS providers for full details.</p>

    <p>If you run into problems with blank white pages or a 500
    internal server error in WordPress, take a look at our helpful
    guide.</p>
    
    <h5 id="host-a-wordpress-site-on-raspberry-pi-success">
      Host a WordPress Site on Raspberry Pi: Success!
    </h5>

    <p>You’re all done now, and a WordPress site is running on your
    Raspberry Pi. As long as the computer remains powered up, the site
    will continue to be accessible. The process is straightforward
    too, requiring you to simply:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Install Apache, PHP, and MySQL</li>
      <li>Download and install WordPress</li>
      <li>Configure the MySQL database</li>
      <li>Create your WordPress database</li>
      <li>Configure WordPress</li>
      <li>Launch the site and access it locally or via the web</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If all of this was a bit overwhelming, we don’t blame
    you. That’s why we recommend using WP Engine to host WordPress
    sites with zero hassle. They manage all administrative issues so
    you can focus on your content.</p>
