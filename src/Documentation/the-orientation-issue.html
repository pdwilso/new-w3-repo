<blockquote>
  
  Media queries allow websites to adjust their layout depending   on the
  screen orientation of a smartphone or tablet. But sometimes you may want
  your website locked to a particular orientation, portrait or landscape. The
  format of native apps can be specified in such a case. The app will then
  only be displayed in the preset format â€“ independently from the actual
  device orientation. By using the HTML5 Screen Orientation API, you can now
  define the screen orientation in JavaScript.
