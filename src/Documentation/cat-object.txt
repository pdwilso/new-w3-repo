Cat Actions:
  These are the methods for a Class Cat object:

    miao
    hiss
    bite
    flee
    jump
    claw
    lick
    nose
    tail
    flic
    leap

  Each of these is an action verb, some of which take parameters:
    miao  - miao [target] ; vocalize a classic "miao" at an (optional) target
    hiss  - hiss [target] ; vocalize a hiss at an (optional) target
        [ note that for vocalization commmands an optional volume prefix may be used e.g. 'loud hiss' or 'soft miao' ]
    bite  - bite something; [strength] bite [target]
    flee  - run away!
    jump  - jump [target];
    claw  - claw [target]; apply a claw to something
    rake  - rake [target]; apply multiple claws to something
    lick  -
    nose
    tail  - signal
    flic  - adjust an ear, tail, paw, perhaps contacting a target in the process
    leap  - leap [target]; move on to target in one move

  These actions can be strung together in sentences using separators to create action scripts or "macros".

  Most of these action commands accept modifiers as either prefixed words, suffixed words, or both.
  All prefix and suffix parameters have defaults.

  The syntax using BNR notation is
  [prefix] [action] [suffix] ["(quoted text character) data"]
